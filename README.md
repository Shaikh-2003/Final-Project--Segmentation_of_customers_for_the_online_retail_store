# Final-Project--Segmentation_of_customers_for_a_retail_store
The "Segmentation of Customers for the  Retail Store" project aims to categorize customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior, to enhance the store's marketing strategies. By understanding customer behavior and preferences, the store can effectively tailor its marketing efforts to target specific segments.
This project highlights the importance of data-driven decision-making in marketing and showcases the power of Python and Google Colab in processing and analyzing large datasets. By segmenting customers effectively, the online retail store can create more personalized and impactful marketing campaigns, driving long-term success.
